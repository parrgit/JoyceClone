            I'm a Frontend Developer with over 5 years of experience. I started
            building website in secondary school using tables but I have since
            learnt better and CSS Grid is now my layouting method of choice.

            I have a passion for creating pixel perfect websites, UX and
            accessibility.

          <h2>Photobox</h2>
          <p>
            The Friday/PA team helped the Photobox in-house dev team to move
            their old website onto a new stack using <span>React</span> and
            <span>GraphQL</span>.<br /><br />

            As part of my role I helped set up a grid system using
            <span>CSS Grid</span>. We used mixins so that it could easily be
            used be other teams across the business. I also helped set up font
            rules and branding in a way that it could easily be replaced with
            branding of the sister companies of the Photobox Group.<br /><br />

            As we were working on a live site as part of the client's
            development team we continuously deployed features as soon as they
            were built and tested.

          <h2>Photobox Editor</h2>
          <p>
            Photobox's old photo editor was still running on Flash and with many
            browsers no longer supporting Flash it was time to update it to a
            more modern stack with <span>React</span>. I joined the team during
            the last two months before handover so I had to quickly get up to
            speed with a complex code base. I used my expertise from the main
            Photobox website to set up branding for the editor so that it could
            also be used for their sister companies. I also implemented a couple
            of new features like swapping images.

          <h2>Nuffield Health gym joining</h2>
          <p>
            In 2016 we first built Nuffield Health's online gym joining
            platform. Prior to this you couldn't join a Nuffield gym online. Gym
            joining has since had a few interations, all of which I was a part
            of. The site is built on a Ruby on Rails backend. The frontend is
            using a more traditional setup using HTML, scss and
            <span>JavaScript</span>.

          <p>
            The Friday website was built using Craft CMS, <span>CSS Grid</span>,
            <span>clip-path</span>
            and ES6. I worked closely with the designers in order to create a
            pixel perfect result.
